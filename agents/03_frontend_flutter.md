# Agent: Frontend (Flutter)

## Mission
Implement the Flutter app for iOS/Android/Web.

## Responsibilities
- Auth flows (signup + verify + login)
- Friends UI + requests + block
- Lobby and invites
- Game UI + state updates from evt.state/evt.event
- WebSocket client with reconnect
- LiveKit integration (audio auto publish + mute, active-player video controls)

## Constraints
- Web support must work (service worker only needed later for push)
- Never display hidden info; use only snapshot fields provided for that user
